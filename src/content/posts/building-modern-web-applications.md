# Building Modern Web Applications

Modern web development has evolved significantly over the past few years. In this post, I'll share some insights about building robust web applications using the latest technologies.

## The Current Landscape

Today's web applications need to be:

- **Fast and responsive** - Users expect immediate feedback
- **Accessible** - Usable by everyone, regardless of abilities
- **Secure** - Protected against common vulnerabilities
- **SEO-friendly** - Discoverable by search engines
- **Maintainable** - Easy to update and extend

## Next.js: The Full-Stack React Framework

Next.js has become my go-to framework for building modern web applications. Here's why:

### Server-Side Rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) provides significant benefits:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  
  return { props: { data } }
}

export default function Home({ data }) {
  return <div>{/* Render your data */}</div>
}
```

### Static Site Generation

For content that doesn't change frequently, static site generation (SSG) offers incredible performance:

```jsx
// pages/blog/[slug].js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Return a list of possible values for slug
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch data based on slug
}
```

## React Server Components

Next.js 15 brings React Server Components, which allow you to render components on the server, reducing JavaScript sent to the client:

```jsx
// app/page.js
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <main>{/* Render your data */}</main>
}
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how we style applications:

```jsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors">
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

Building modern web applications requires carefully choosing the right tools and techniques. With Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, you have a powerful foundation for creating fast, accessible, and maintainable web experiences.

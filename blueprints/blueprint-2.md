# Blueprint 2: Enhanced Features Implementation

## Overview

This blueprint outlines the next phase of development for the blog, focusing on implementing dark mode, static site generation (SSG), a personalized homepage, and additional features aligned with modern web development practices.

## Dark Mode Implementation

### Requirements
- Support system preference detection
- Allow manual toggle between light/dark modes
- Persist user preference with local storage
- Seamless integration with shadcn/ui and Next.js

### Technical Approach
1. Implement with `next-themes` package for Next.js compatibility
2. Configure Tailwind CSS for dark mode variants
3. Update shadcn/ui components to respond to theme changes
4. Add a theme toggle component in the header
5. Ensure smooth transitions between modes

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

### Requirements
- Generate all pages at build time for optimal performance
- Implement incremental static regeneration for content updates
- Ensure SEO-friendly output with proper metadata
- Optimize image loading and processing

### Technical Approach
1. Use Next.js's `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for all content pages
2. Configure proper caching strategies
3. Implement image optimization with Next.js Image component
4. Add structured data for rich search results
5. Configure revalidation periods for content updates

## Homepage Enhancements

### Requirements
- Create a personal introduction section
- Showcase featured blog posts
- Display skills and areas of expertise
- Add contact/social media information
- Ensure responsive design across all devices

### Technical Approach
1. Design a hero section with personal introduction
2. Create a featured posts grid with custom filtering
3. Add an interactive skills/expertise section
4. Implement social media links and contact form
5. Ensure accessibility compliance throughout

## Additional Features

### Improved Search Functionality
- Implement client-side search with fuzzy matching
- Add filter options for tags and categories
- Show search suggestions as user types

### Reading Experience

- Implement table of contents for longer articles
- Add progressive loading for images
- Support code syntax highlighting in markdown

### Analytics and Performance
- Add privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible/Umami)
- Implement Core Web Vitals optimization
- Add service worker for offline support
- Configure proper cache policies

## Implementation Priority

1. Dark mode implementation
2. Static site generation configuration
3. Homepage redesign
4. Search improvements
5. Reading experience enhancements
6. Analytics and performance optimizations

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase
- Follow the component structure established in Blueprint 1
- Ensure responsive design at all breakpoints
- Keep accessibility as a priority for all new components
- Maintain a clean, modular architecture

# Blueprint 1 (DONE) 

## Overview

This blueprint outlines the high-level architecture for a modern Next.js 15 blog using Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and Markdown content.

## Core Architecture

We'll use a **Blueprint-Construct** pattern:
- **Blueprints**: Define what components should do
- **Constructs**: Implement those components

This separation helps keep code organized and maintainable.

## Key Features

- SEO optimization

## Basic Implementation Plan

1. Set up project structure
2. Install shadcn/ui
3. Configure Markdown processing
4. Create blog components
5. Build page layouts
6. Add sample content

## Blog Post Format

Each post will include:
- Title and slug
- Publication date
- Preview excerpt
- Main content
- Optional: author, tags, cover image
